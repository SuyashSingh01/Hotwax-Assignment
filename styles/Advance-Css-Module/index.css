/* Task
You are writing a responsive layout for a website that has dramatically different layouts for mobile and desktop. Which of the following media queries would you use and why?

@media (max-width: …
@media (min-width: …


*/

/* Answer
You would use @media (max-width: ...) for mobile layouts and @media (min-width: ...) for desktop layouts. The max-width query applies styles when the viewport width is less than or equal to a specified value, which is ideal for mobile devices. Conversely, the min-width query applies styles when the viewport width is greater than or equal to a specified value, suitable for desktop devices.

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  /* Styles for mobile devices */
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
@media (min-width: 601px) {
  /* Styles for desktop devices */
  body {
    background-color: lightgreen;
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}
